The Overpass API (formerly known as OSM Server Side Scripting, or OSM3S
before 2011) is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of
the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a
query to the API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query.

Before you can run overpass you'll need to create the database;
please see README.setup.

Before building overpass software package you need "overpass" user and group.
This can be done with the following commands:

     # groupadd -g 367 overpass
     # useradd -u 367 -g 367 -d /var/lib/overpass overpass

Feel free to use a different uid and gid if desired, but 367 is recommended to
avoid conflicts with other stuff from SlackBuilds.org.
